- 👋 Hi, I’m @quangntenemy
- 👀 I’m interested in fun things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Leadership, and also on my quest to find the meaning of life 😛
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all fun things
- 📫 How to reach me: maybe I'm most active on [Discord](https://discord.gg/c9rAJvbRWn), Gmail, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/quangntenemy) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-nguyen-29251a16/). You should visit [my blog](https://quangntenemy.blogspot.com/) sometimes too 😛
- I have created many challs for [TBS](https://www.bright-shadows.net/), [Rankk](https://www.rankk.org/) and [WeChall](https://www.wechall.net/), which I used to list on my old website, and maybe will list again here when I have time. Also note that I still have 2 unpublished challenges (and a lot of ideas too 😛)
- On my old website there used to be some interesting things I used to code, which I'll try to recover and put back to Github in the future 😛
- On my old website you might find my favourite Hex editor, which could help you solve some stegano challenges 😛 - **Hint:** it's [Hiew](https://www.hiew.ru/)
- [Here's](https://www.flickr.com/photos/22823442@N02/) the link to my Flickr photos, which you might find interesting 😛
- [Here's](http://www.geocities.com/quangntenemy/best2.jpg) the link to my minigolf record, which is currently down and I haven't found a way to recover 😛
- Maybe you'll also be interested in [Steganabara](https://github.com/quangntenemy/Steganabara), a cool and also one of the first few steganalysis tools which now I'm struggling to allocate time for a new version 😛
- I used to spend a lot of time creating cool things, I thought I was busy but now I'm totally overloaded 😛
- (Maybe) the world is rotten ☠
